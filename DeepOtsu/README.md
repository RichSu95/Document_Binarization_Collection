# DeepOtsu
The implementation and the pre-trained models by the authors  are available at http://www.ai.rug.nl/~sheng/DeepOtsu_tf.tar.gz.

### Environment
Install requirements.txt file

### Structure
-dataset: the directory of the input images
-imgtype: image type, such as png,jpg,tiff, etc.
-overlap: the overlap of crop small patches (default: 0.1) The larger of this value (maximum: 1.0), the smaller of the number of patches and the faster for running.
-multiscale: whether use multiscale patches (default: True) Set it to False will fast the running.
-num_block: (number of UNets used in the program, default: 6), but 3 might also good. The smaller of this number, the faster of running.

### Testing
```bash
python binTestImprovedFusion.py --dataset directory_or_image/ --imgtype png --overlap 0.1 --multiscale True --num_block 6
```
